## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    The client for this school project was DriverPass, a fictitious business. The system that they had me design 
    was a web application. 

    The application was to be used by:
    - Student drivers to help pass their driving exam via driving lessons, online courses and practice tests
    - Instructors to be assigned to driving lessons
    - The business to track user information, provide content, maintain schedule, accept payments


## What did you do particularly well?

    I did well with:
    - Analyzing the needs of the business, students, and other users
    - Identified functional and non functional requirements
    - Made strong recommendations to meet technical requirements


## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    After reviewing my work, I realize that improvements could be made to the diagrams as well as using qualitative and 
    quantitative examples to support my recommendations and analysis. The diagrams could ahve been much more 
    comprehensive to include checking for authentication loops and deicision nodes in the activity diagrams. By adding 
    this to my diagrams I would improve data density and insight provided to the audience. I would add the decision 
    diamonds into my activity diagram and create if loops to represent if a decision was true or false.


## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    Interpreted user's needs by
    - Reviewing interview transcripts from meetings with business owner, and other key stakeholders
    - Follow best practices for security, scalability, maintainability, etc.

    It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing a system is to provide the user with seamless, 
    reactive and fucntional delivery of services. With that in mind, a system is designed simply to be a convienience to
    the user. The system needs to be deisgned with this in mind to instill optimized practices in the design from the 
    start to handle all possible use cases. Refining the design through time will create a well rounded system through 
    user-feedback as well.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    My approach was to first, gather requirements and information from key stakeholders Then, analyze requirements and 
    refine them iteratively. Followed by, designing the foundation of the program using UML diagrams and GANTT chart for 
    timeline planning.
