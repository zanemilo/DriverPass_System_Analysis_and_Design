 ## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    DriverPass
    System type is a web application
    Used by student drivers to help pass their driving exam via driving lessons, online courses and practice tests
    Used by instructors to be assigned to driving lessons
    Used by the business to track user information, provide content, maintain schedule, accept payments


 ## What did you do particularly well?

    I did well with
    Analyzing the needs of the business, students, and other users
    Identified functional and non functional requirements
    Made strong recommendations to meet technical requirements


## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    After reviewing my work, I realize that improvements could be made to the diagrams as well as using qualitative and quantitative examples to support my recommendations and analysis.


## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    Interpreted user's needs by
    Reviewing interview transcripts from meetings with business owner, and other key stakeholders
    Follow best practices for security, scalability, maintainability, etc.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    My approach
    Gather requirements and information from key stakeholders
    Analyze requirements and refine them iteratively
    Design the foundation of the program using UML diagrams and GANTT chart for timeline planning
