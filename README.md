For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit the business requirements document. From Project Two, submit the system design document. Together, these documents showcase your work in system analysis and design. These documents demonstrate your ability to collect requirements from the customer and design a system that meets those needs.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It also will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    DriverPass
    System type is a web application
    Used by student drivers to help pass their driving exam via driving lessons, online courses and practice tests
    Used by instructors to be assigned to driving lessons
    Used by the business to track user information, provide content, maintain schedule, accept payments


    What did you do particularly well?

    I did well with
    Analyzing the needs of the business, students, and other users
    Identified functional and non functional requirements
    Made strong recommendations to meet technical requirements


    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    After reviewing my work, I realize that improvements could be made to the diagrams as well as using qualitative and quantitative examples to support my recommendations and analysis.


    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    Interpreted user's needs by
    Reviewing interview transcripts from meetings with business owner, and other key stakeholders
    Follow best practices for security, scalability, maintainability, etc.

    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    My approach
    Gather requirements and information from key stakeholders
    Analyze requirements and refine them iteratively
    Design the foundation of the program using UML diagrams and GANTT chart for timeline planning
